# Midterm Report

## ITMT 430 2019 - Deborah Barndt

### Sprint 1

1. Accomplishments:
- Researched on color schemes and branding with color theory for our QuadRangle app, and researched on similar applications such as Neighbors by Ring, Nextdoor, etc.
    - For picking the best color scheme for our app, I researched and read about color theory and what each of the colors mean, what they portray, and who uses them and found out that the cool colors; green, blue, and purple are used by companies who want to display health, beauty, or security and it was best to stick with blue or green. Then I used Adobe Color to help me narrow down and pick our specific color scheme from the research I did on the colors. I also did a search for any other applications that were similar to ours, which was Neighbors by Ring, Nextdoor, Facebook, etc and showed the research to the team. Each of these different applications helped the team to better understand what type of application we wanted to build, what we wanted to offer, how we wanted to do the layout, etc.

- Discussed the project requirements and technologies that we would want to use for our app
    - The team met together to brainstorm and discuss the project requirements while in the smart lab about what we needed to do, how we wanted to do it, what we wanted to use for our applications, who needed to do what, discussed who was going to take what role, etc. All of our brainstorming was written down on the white board and we took pictures of what we discussed for future reference.

- Created quick hand sketches for layout of the app
    - From the research on the different similar applications and discussion with the team about our application, I hand drew some quick sketches of our layout of our application. The team decided that we wanted a layout similar to Facebook and Nextdoor because it had a nice clean feel.

- Researched on collaborative prototype apps to create our digital sketches
    - After the hand drawn sketch was created, I then researched on applications to create a digital sketch version of our layout that would allow for collaboration due to every team member switching roles. This way it would be easier to make any changes, everyone could view it, everyone would have access, etc. However, I discovered that there were not many applications that allowed for collaboration. Below are the links to the different digital prototype applications that I researched and read up on the benefits and reviews of. In the end, I ended up using Protoshare, which is an application that works with Google Drive, so we could add the application to our team drive that I created and then everyone would have access to the files.

- Created several logo designs for our winning application name after the vote
    - After our name our application vote was completed, I designed several logo designs that we could use for our QuadRangle App. Each of the designs were created in Adobe Illustrator. I created five different versions of the logo and then posted them up in our Google Team Drive to be viewed and voted upon by the team. The final logo design ended up to be the v5, which I then created a version with a background and one without, then had to shrink the image size and file size to be easily displayed on the web.

- Created skeletal layout for the application pages
    - When the digital prototype was created in Protoshare, the skeletal html and css was created for the QuadRangle home page and login page as part of the applications features. I also added the logo and had to change the size of the logo to be the size of an icon to fit. However, some of the layout didn't translate well and the code needed to be adjusted. 

2. Correlate goals:
- Voted on web app project including minimal features to consider
- Digital and paper sketches drawn out

### Sprint 2

1. Accomplishments:
- Ensured frequent communication and had weekly meetings to get updates on progress and if anyone needs assistance
    - Each week we met as a group in the Galvin library to discuss the progress of the project and I asked each of the team members if they needed assistance with any of their tasks and what their progress was on each task. I also communicated with each of the team members via Slack and Group Me.
- Ensured that the tasks were addressed, assigned, and completed on the Trello board
    - In the previous sprint, it was mentioned that there were Trello cards that were not assigned and that some tasks were not addressed. So I created Trello cards for each of the tasks and goals that we needed to accomplish and made sure that they were assigned to the specified team members and labeled with the correct roles.
- Revised select items from feedback on our sprint report for clarification for our next sprint report
    - In the previous sprint, we received feedback on some of the items in our sprint report that needed revision. I made Trello cards for each of the items that needed revising to remind myself to address them in the sprint 2 report and revise the wording of each of the items per the feedback given.
- Assisted developers with using MongoDB and the setup of MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Community Edition, and Postman
    - Four of the team members were not familiar with MongoDB, so I met with each of them and showed them how to install and use MongoDB and what version to install, how to install and use MongoDB Compass and what version to install, and how to install and use Postman with MongoDB. Each of the team members were then able to successfully get working on their personal computers MongoDB, MongoDB Compass, and Postman to use for our application.

2. Correlate goals:
- Make sure to assign each user to their specific tasks and label them according to position on Trello
- Revise statement on data quality assurance (from feedback)
- Review authentication description from feedback
- Create a better description of encryption at rest

### Sprint 3

1. Accomplishments:
- Made the prototype html pages responsive to the correct screen sizes
    - I worked with Martae to fix the html code of the digital prototype to make the homepage and login page to be responsive to the correct screen sizes, because we found out that the screen size options that the Protoshare provided was not correct and was smaller than the desktop screen size.
    
    ![updatedprototype](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/dbarndt/blob/master/itmt-430/images/updatedprototype.png "updated prototype")
- Researched on various Bootstrap, WordPress, and Open Source social network templates for our QuadRangle app
    - I researched on Bootstrap and WordPress templates for social networking templates, admin templates, and google maps templates for our QuadRangle app. Then put it to a vote with the team which template they preferred and downloaded the template package to begin adjustments. The admin template is still being discussed to make sure that we pick the one with the right features we need.

- Implemented test templates of our QuadRangle app pages to a separate branch
    - Once the Olympus Bootstrap template was chosen, I started testing out the template code on a separate branch called template to make sure that I could get it functioning and working correctly without messing with the master branch. This was important, because there was a lot of changes that needed to be made to the template color wise and images. I also worked with Martae to show him how the template works and what branch to use when trying to tweek the template to our needs.

- Research to find out why custom image files and paths are not working on the templates
    - It was the first time working with this type of a bootstrap template, and once I started testing out the template I noticed that the images were not showing up as per the demo. Some of the issues was that they placed the images in different folders and others we discovered will require being installed to the server. Some of the images we got to work and were able to implement our custom logo to the bootstrap template successfully on the homepage and login page, but more work still needs to be done to get the images to show up and fix all of the paths.

- Assisted everyone in successfully deploying to Firebase on their machines
    - When the switch to Firebase was decided, I helped everyone else accept the invites to Firebase for our group and helped them to find the instructions and implement them and then made sure that they could successfully see it on their machines via localhost.

2. Correlate goals:
- Adjust frame of pages to stretch entire width of page(if not, look into Bootstrap)
- Research Google Maps API and creating a frame
- Research how to work with Search Bars and implement into QuadRangle app
- Test to ensure that the application with Firebase
