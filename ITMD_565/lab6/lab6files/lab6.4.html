    Introduction:
        In this lab we will be experimenting with some React core concepts 
        like elements, components, and JSX.

    Objective:
       The objective is to build a React class and functional components 
       with and without JSX. This lab files will be submitted with GitHub 
       to your private illinoistech-itm repository and you will just submit 
       the URL of your GitHub repository to the blackboard assignment. 
       
    Requirements/Process:
        •	You must submit this Lab via your illinoistech-itm GitHub 
            repository that was setup in the Github Lab.
        •	Please create a new lab6 folder for this lab inside your class 
            folder in your repository and keep all your files for this lab 
            there.
        •	Submit the URL to your illinoistech-itm GitHub repository to 
            the assignment on blackboard before the due date.
        •	Use the supplied html files as the start of the lab.
        •	The supplied starter files have React, ReactDOM, and Babel CDN 
            links
        •	Make sure you are looking at your browser’s dev tools console 
            for errors if you are having issues.
    Part 4:
        •	Use supplied file lab6.4.html for this part.
        •	You can not use JSX for Part 4. Use a class-based component 
            for Part 4.
        •	Create a single class based React component called Product.
        •	The Product component will take in a single prop called product 
            and is expecting data in the form of an object. This will be an 
            object representing JSON data for one product. The product data 
            is defined in the supplied file.
        •	Pass the data object for the single product to the Product 
            component and then inside the component use that object for 
            the img src, product name, and product desc. Do not pass 
            separate props, pass in the one object and use it.
        •	When rendered this should look identical to Part 2, use the 
            same html elements as described in Part 2.
        •	Using ReactDOM render the Product element to the page in the 
            div with id of app.

    Graduate Additional Requirements: 
        If you are involved in any section of 565 you need to complete 
        the additional requirements listed here. 
        
        You must do an additional part 4. In part 4 you will do the exact 
        same thing you did in part 3 but without using any JSX. Do all 
        the createElement function calls yourself.
