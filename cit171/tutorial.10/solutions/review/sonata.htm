   <h2>Sonata</h2>
   <p>A musical composition for one or more instruments. The term also refers 
      to the musical form typical of the first movements of 18th-century sonatas 
      and related genres. Since the mid-18th century, the term sonata has 
      generally been used for works in a three- or four-movement format for one 
      or two instruments, as in the piano sonata (for solo piano) or violin 
      sonata (for violin with a keyboard instrument).
