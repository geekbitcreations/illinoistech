<!--
SYNTAX:
The syntax for the "refresh" meta command is  
                <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="N; URL=other-web-address"> 
where N is the approximate number of seconds that you want the current web page to be displayed before the browser automatically goes 
to the other web address. If N = 0, then the browser should go immediately to the other web address. 

TIP:
In case someone's browser doesn't handle these automatic redirects (most browsers do handle them, but some allow them to be turned off, 
as a way of discouraging "web spam", which often uses this type of "refresh" redirect), you may want to provide a second route to the intended 
destination by way of a standard link. See the link in the <body> tag.

<!-- zero second redirect delay (or as close to zero as you can get) because the attribute named content has an value beginning with 0  -->
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=http://www.yahoo.com">
