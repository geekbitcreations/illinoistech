<h1>GET Example with JavaScript Submit Command</h1>
<p>This is an example of how to use GET HTTP Method with the JavaScript submit command.</p>
<p>When you use GET the contents of your form will become url encoded into a <span style="color:blue">query string</span> appended after a ? as name=value pairs. For example if your form was submitted to form_processor.html and took your firstName and your lastName - the corresponding query string attached to the URL would be…..  <br>form_processor.html<span style="color:blue">?firstName=Santa&lastName=Claus</span></p>

<p>After you click the Submit button look to see how the form data was passed as a query string in the Web browser address bar.</p> 

<!--
note that the  form's method attribute contains the "get" value  -->
<form name="myForm"
      action="form_processor.html" 
      method="get"
      enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">

<!--
IMPORTANT: note that you must have the name attribute here in the input tag for the
querystring to be passed when the submit button is clicked. if you don't give your 
input box a name the value will not be passed when the form is submitted -->
firstName: <input type="text" name="firstName" value="Santa" />
<br>
lastName:  <input type="text" name="lastName" value="Claus" />
<br>

<!-- note that we are submitting this form using javascript's submit command -->
<input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="document.myForm.submit();" />

</form>
