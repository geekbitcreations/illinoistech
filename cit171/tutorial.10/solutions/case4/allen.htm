      The Tombstone Vigilantes stage mock gunfights and hangings to the delight 
      of our many tourists. This photo shows a tourist about to be hanged for 
      some offense in front of the Crystal Palace saloon. Don't worry, though, 
      most of our tourists escape unharmed at the end of their visit!

      Today, Allen Street is lined with small shops and art galleries. The 
      shop keepers welcome you and are eager to share some of the old
      Tombstone stories.
