<!--  Meta Charset Tag in HTML5:
       The HTML5 editors looked at the fact that developers were writing the meta tag incorrectly 
       and that browsers were interpreting it anyway, and decided to make this shortened syntax valid. 
       Now with HTML5 you can add your character encoding with a much easier to remember META element:
       <meta charset=utf-8>
