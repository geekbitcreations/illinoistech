<h1>Dynamic Query String Example with JavaScript Location Object</h1>
<p>This is an example of how to build a dynamic query string and use it with the JavaScript location object.</p>
<p>The contents of your form will become url encoded into a <span style="color:blue">query string</span> appended after a ? as name=value pairs. For example if your form was submitted to form_processor.html and took your firstName and your lastName - the corresponding query string attached to the URL would be…..  <br>form_processor.html<span style="color:blue">?firstName=Santa&lastName=Claus</span></p>

<p>After you click the Submit button look to see how the form data was passed as a query string in the Web browser address bar.</p> 

<!--
IMPORTANT: note that this form does NOT  have a method attribute or an action attribute or even the name attribute -->
<form>

<!--
IMPORTANT: note that you must have the id attribute here in the input tag for the
value to be retrieved by the javascript getElementByID method -->
firstName: <input type="text" id="firstName" value="Santa" />
<br>
lastName:  <input type="text" id="lastName" value="Claus" />
<br>

<!-- note that we are submitting this form using javascript's location object -->
<input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="submitForm();" />

</form>
