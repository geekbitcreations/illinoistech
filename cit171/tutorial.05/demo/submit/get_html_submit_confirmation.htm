<h1>GET Example with HTML Submit Button with Confirmation</h1>
<p>This is an example of how to use GET HTTP Method with an HTML submit button with Confirmation.</p>
<p>When you use GET the contents of your form will become url encoded into a <span style="color:blue">query string</span> appended after a ? as name=value pairs. For example if your form was submitted to form_processor.html and took your firstName and your lastName - the corresponding query string attached to the URL would be…..  <br>form_processor.html<span style="color:blue">?firstName=Santa&lastName=Claus</span></p>

<p>After you click the Submit button look to see how the form data was passed as a query string in the Web browser address bar.</p> 

<!--
note that the  form's method attribute contains the "get" value  
IMPORTANT: note that this form has the event onsubmit.event. when the user clicks the 
submit button on this form, the onsubmit event is triggered and the user defined javascript
function named confirmSubmit is executed. the function named confirmSubmit will then return 
back either the value of true of false, which is then passed to the onsubmit event here in the form 
tag. if the value of false is passed to the onsubmit function the form will not be submitted. if the
value of true is passed to the onsubmit event the form will be submitted. -->
<form name="myForm"
      onsubmit="return confirmSubmit();"
      action="form_processor.html" 
      method="get"
      enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">

<!--
IMPORTANT: note that you must have the name attribute here in the input tag for the
querystring to be passed when the submit button is clicked. if you don't give your 
input box a name the value will not be passed when the form is submitted -->
firstName: <input type="text" name="firstName" value="Santa" />
<br>
lastName:  <input type="text" name="lastName" value="Claus" />
<br>

<!-- note that we are submitting this form using the HMTL submit button -->
<input type="submit"/>
