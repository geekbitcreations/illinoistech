    Introduction:
        In this lab we will be experimenting with some React core concepts 
        like elements, components, and JSX.

    Objective:
       The objective is to build a React class and functional components 
       with and without JSX. This lab files will be submitted with GitHub 
       to your private illinoistech-itm repository and you will just submit 
       the URL of your GitHub repository to the blackboard assignment. 
       
    Requirements/Process:
        •	You must submit this Lab via your illinoistech-itm GitHub 
            repository that was setup in the Github Lab.
        •	Please create a new lab6 folder for this lab inside your class 
            folder in your repository and keep all your files for this lab 
            there.
        •	Submit the URL to your illinoistech-itm GitHub repository to 
            the assignment on blackboard before the due date.
        •	Use the supplied html files as the start of the lab.
        •	The supplied starter files have React, ReactDOM, and Babel CDN 
            links
        •	Make sure you are looking at your browser’s dev tools console 
            for errors if you are having issues.
    Part 1:
        •	Use supplied file lab6.1.html for this part.
        •	Do not use any JSX for Part 1.
        •	Create a functional React component called headline, as shown 
            in class.
        •	The headline component when rendered on the page should be an 
            h1 tag with the following text inside:
            o	ITMD-4/565 Lab 6 Part 1 – your name here
        •	The headline element should have a property called name that 
            you use in the text of the element instead of putting your name 
            in the element directly.
        •	No JSX, you must create the React elements manually as shown in 
            class.
        •	Using ReactDOM render the headline element to the page in the 
            div with id of app.
