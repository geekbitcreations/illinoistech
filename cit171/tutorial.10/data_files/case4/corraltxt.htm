      The 
      Perhaps the most famous landmark in Tombstone (and, arguably, 
      in all of the southwest) is the OK Corral. It was in this small space 
      that the Earp brothers along with their friend &quot;Doc&quot; Holiday 
      faced members of the Clanton and McLaury families in a famous gunfight. 
      You are welcomed to &quot;walk where they walk&quot; and relive that moment 
      in American history.
