    Introduction:
        In this lab we will be experimenting with some React core concepts 
        like elements, components, and JSX.

    Objective:
       The objective is to build a React class and functional components 
       with and without JSX. This lab files will be submitted with GitHub 
       to your private illinoistech-itm repository and you will just submit 
       the URL of your GitHub repository to the blackboard assignment. 
       
    Requirements/Process:
        •	You must submit this Lab via your illinoistech-itm GitHub 
            repository that was setup in the Github Lab.
        •	Please create a new lab6 folder for this lab inside your class 
            folder in your repository and keep all your files for this lab 
            there.
        •	Submit the URL to your illinoistech-itm GitHub repository to 
            the assignment on blackboard before the due date.
        •	Use the supplied html files as the start of the lab.
        •	The supplied starter files have React, ReactDOM, and Babel CDN 
            links
        •	Make sure you are looking at your browser’s dev tools console 
            for errors if you are having issues.
    Part 2:
        •	Use supplied file lab6.2.html for this part.
        •	You can use JSX for Part 2. Use functional components for 
            Part 2.
        •	You will be creating four functional React components for this 
            part. These components will form a product listing.
        •	Here are the component names: ProductImage, ProductName, 
            ProductDesc, Product
        •	The product component will be a wrapper around the other 
            components. You should return a div element with the three 
            other components nested inside. The order should be image, 
            name, desc.
        •	The image src, product name, and product desc should be passed 
            in as props to the components. They are defined as constants in 
            the supplied file to use. Image should be an image tag, name 
            should be an h2, desc should be wrapped in a p.
        •	Using ReactDOM render the Product element to the page in the div 
            with id of app.
