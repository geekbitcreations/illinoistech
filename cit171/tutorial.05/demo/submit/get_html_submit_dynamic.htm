<h1>GET Example with Dynamic HTML Submit Button</h1>
<p>This is an example of how to use GET HTTP Method with a dynamic HTML submit button. A possible use for this type of setup with three submit buttons would be one button for Add, one for Delete, and another for Change.</p>
<p>When you use GET the contents of your form will become url encoded into a <span style="color:blue">query string</span> appended after a ? as name=value pairs. For example if your form was submitted to form_processor.html and took your firstName and your lastName - the corresponding query string attached to the URL would be…..  <br>form_processor.html<span style="color:blue">?firstName=Santa&lastName=Claus</span></p>

<p>After you click the Submit button look to see how the form data was passed as a query string in the Web browser address bar.</p> 

<!--
note that the  form's method attribute contains the "get" value  
IMPORTANT: note that this form has the event onsubmit.event. when the user clicks the 
submit button on this form, the onsubmit event is triggered and the user defined javascript
function named dynamicSubmit is executed. the function named dynmaicSubmit will then 
always return back the value of true, which is then passed to the onsubmit event here in the form 
tag. not that when the value of true is passed to the onsubmit event the form will be submitted.
IMPORT: note that there is no action atrribute in this form tag -->
<form name="myForm"
      onsubmit="return dynamicSubmit();"
      method="get"
      enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">

<!--
IMPORTANT: note that you must have the name attribute here in the input tag for the
querystring to be passed when the submit button is clicked. if you don't give your 
input box a name the value will not be passed when the form is submitted -->
firstName: <input type="text" name="firstName" value="Santa" />
<br>
lastName:  <input type="text" name="lastName" value="Claus" />
<br>

<!-- note that we have three  HTML submit buttons here. a possible use for this type of setup would be a button for Add, one for Delete, another for Change
      also note that buttonValue is a global variable, not a property or method of the document object -->
<input type="submit" value="Submit to form_processor.html" onclick="buttonValue=this.value;" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit to Google" onclick="buttonValue=this.value;" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit to Yahoo" onclick="buttonValue=this.value;" />

</form>
